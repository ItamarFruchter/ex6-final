two main regEx use:
1.	when we tried to analyze for each line what type of line it is, we created a regEx 
	pattern	that describes what each type of line should contain. for example, a line 
	that assigns value to a member of our code is of the pattern: 
	"\\s*\\w+\\s*=\\s*[\\w\"\\.']+\\s*;\\s*". this pattern says "[as many spaces as we want]
	[at least one word char][as many spaces as we want]	['=' char][at least one value char]
	[as many spaces as we want][';' char][as many spaces as we want]"

2.	when we wanted to check if a certain value is a valid value of a certain type of 
	value we used a regEx pattern of each type's value demands. for example, for the type
	Boolean we used the pattern: "\\s*((-?\\d+(\\.\\d+)?)|true|false)\\s*".
	this pattern say "[as many spaces as we want](['-' char, maybe]
